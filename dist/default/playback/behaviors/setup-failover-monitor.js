/**
* **CDN failover cooldown.** The expiry half of multi-CDN failover. Fetch sites
* own the *trip*: on a failed fetch they add the failing CDN (origin) to the
* `failedCdns` state signal directly. This behavior owns the *expiry*: while a
* presentation is resolved, it watches `failedCdns` and, for each CDN that
* appears, schedules a timer to remove it once its cooldown lapses.
* `track-switching`'s `excludeFailedCdns` constraint prunes a failed CDN's
* tracks and the active-CDN scope falls to the next one — and back, once the
* cooldown removes it here.
*
* Lifecycle is per-source: timers + `failedCdns` are cleared on exit (a new
* source starts with a clean slate). Policy (cooldown) is engine config. This is
* the minimal `network-resilience` slice — a single failure trips a CDN, since
* transient blips are the retry layer's job (it sits below the fetch sites, so
* anything that reaches `failedCdns` is already terminal).
