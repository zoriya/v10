/**
* Recover the end-of-stream stall that Chrome exhibits on skewed A/V. After
* `endOfStream`, when the audio and video tracks end a few ms apart (e.g. a source
* with an A/V PTS skew), Chrome's audio-clock-paced playback freezes the playhead
* ~50–70ms short of the reachable buffered end and never fires `ended` — so playback
* hangs at the very end and loop never re-triggers. This behavior watches for the
* `waiting` event that fires at that freeze and, when the MediaSource is `ended` and
* the playhead sits at the reachable buffered end, nudges `currentTime` to `duration`
* to force the native `ended`.
*
* **Event-driven, no poll.** `waiting` fires at the instant the playhead stalls
* (measured ~0ms latency), so there's nothing to gain from polling — and polling would
* add its interval + a stall threshold before reacting.
*
* **Proximity to the *reachable* buffered end** is the discriminator. That end is
* `getMinBufferedEnd(mediaSource.sourceBuffers)` — the `min` of the per-track (video/audio)
* SourceBuffer ends, i.e. the furthest point playback can reach — read from the SourceBuffers
* directly rather than the `mediaElement.buffered` aggregate. Once `endOfStream` is signalled
* that's the true content end. Requiring the playhead within `endStallNudgeWindow` of it
* distinguishes the real end-of-stream freeze from a mid-stream buffer-hole stall (which sits
* far from the buffered end), so we never skip content. The window must exceed the freeze gap;
* too small would miss the stall (a permanent hang), so the default is generous relative to the
* measured gap and is config-tunable for empirical tuning.
*
* Inert where it shouldn't act: live (the MediaSource never reaches `ended` while the
* window grows; `duration` is `Infinity`) and streams that end cleanly (no `waiting`).
*
* See `internal/decisions/spf/end-of-stream-av-skew-recovery.md`.
