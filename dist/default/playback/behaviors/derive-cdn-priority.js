/**
* **Session-level CDN priority.** While a presentation is resolved, owns the
* `cdnPriority` signal: the distinct CDNs the source is served from (origin of
* each track's URL), in manifest priority order — most-preferred first. Cleared
* on src unload. The name mirrors HLS content steering's `PATHWAY-PRIORITY`.
*
* Redundant-stream sources (e.g. Mux's `?redundant_streams=true`) list the same
* content on multiple hosts, so the candidate tracks already include one variant
* per CDN. This behavior publishes *which* CDNs exist and their priority; the
* `preferActiveCdn` scope rule in `track-switching` reads `cdnPriority` and
* narrows each type's candidates to the first CDN with surviving tracks — so
* video / audio / text all resolve from one host (the shared list is the
* per-presentation coherence guarantee).
*
* The "active" CDN is not stored — it's derived by the scope as the
* highest-priority entry in `cdnPriority` that still has tracks after the
* constraints pre-pass. That makes failover a pure consequence of the (future)
* failed-CDN constraint: when the primary's tracks are pruned during cooldown,
* the scope falls to the next CDN; when the primary recovers, it snaps back.
* Content steering, when it lands, reorders `cdnPriority` (pathway priority as a
* sort key).
*
* Lifecycle: `'presentation-unresolved'` ↔ `'presentation-resolved'`, mirroring
* `setupTrackSwitching`. The resolved state owns the signal; its entry-returned
* cleanup clears it on exit (canonical cleanup-binds-to-setup per `reactors.md`).
