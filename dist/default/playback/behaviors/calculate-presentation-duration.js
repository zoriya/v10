/**
* `calculatePresentationDuration` uses a manual `Behavior<>` literal
* (rather than `defineBehavior`) so it can declare just `presentation`
* in its stateKeys while the typed setup-param shape includes the
* optional `selectedVideoTrackId` / `selectedAudioTrackId` reads used
* at runtime. Mirrors the pattern in `endOfStream` for the same
* reason: the behavior is uniform-across-tracks and reads slots
* contributed by other behaviors, so it shouldn't leak those slot
* declarations into variants that don't compose the contributors.
