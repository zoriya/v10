/**
* **Own the text-track slots on the host media element, mirroring the SPF
* model.** When a presentation is resolved and a media element is
* available, allocate one slot in `mediaElement.textTracks` per model text
* track — via creating `<track>` children, since that's the only spec
* mechanism for adding *and* removing entries to `textTracks` (no
* `removeTextTrack` API exists). Once slots are provisioned, mirror the
* resolved `selectedTextTrackId` into their `mode`s (one-way: state → DOM),
* and propagate user-initiated DOM `change` events back to
* `userTextTrackSelection` — the standing *intent* (a language-based partial,
* or `'off'`) that `switchTextTrack` resolves into `selectedTextTrackId`. So
* non-SPF consumers (host-page captions buttons, browser native UI, video.js
* store) drive selection by expressing intent, not by writing the resolved id.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor (`'preconditions-unmet'` ↔ `'sync-active'`):
* the entry allocates the slots, applies the initial selection, attaches
* the `change` listener, and opens a brief Chromium settling-window guard —
* all transition-driven, fire-once on state entry, with paired cleanup on
* state exit. A single `effects:` mirrors subsequent
* `selectedTextTrackId` changes into `mode`s; that's the only
* continuous-reactivity concern.
*
* State-exit cleanup also sends a `'clear'` message to the
* `TextTracksActor` so its cue+segment cache (keyed by trackId) is
* dropped alongside the DOM `<track>` slots. The actor itself is owned
* by `setupTextTrackActors` and bound to mediaElement, not presentation,
* so it survives source resets; clearing its context here keeps the
* cache consistent with the DOM. Without this, a subsequent
* presentation reusing a trackId would have `getSegmentsToLoad` treat
* its segments as already-buffered and skip loading them.
*
* Single-writer separation: `selectedTextTrackId` is the resolved *output*
* owned solely by `switchTextTrack`; this behavior only reads it (to mirror
* modes). The write path here is `userTextTrackSelection` — the user-intent
* *input* — so DOM action and the resolver never contend for one slot. The
* intent isn't cleared on source unload (it's a standing preference, like
* `userAudioTrackSelection`); `'off'` is written when the user disables all
* tracks via native UI.
*
* Echo guard: `selectedTextTrackId` is exactly the id this behavior last drove
* into the DOM, so a `change` event still showing it is our own echo (or a
* resolver-driven correction — e.g. the picked track's CDN failed and the
* resolver disabled it) and is ignored, never written back as a spurious user
* action. Only a showing id that *differs* from the resolved id is a real user
* pick. The settling-window guard additionally swallows Chromium's init-time
* auto-selection before the resolved selection has settled.
