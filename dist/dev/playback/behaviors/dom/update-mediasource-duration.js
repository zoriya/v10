/**
* **Propagate `presentation.duration` to `mediaSource.duration` — exactly
* once per MediaSource.**
*
* When the presentation has a valid positive duration (including `Infinity`
* for live) and a MediaSource is in context, writes the value through to
* `mediaSource.duration` on initial setup — once, while `mediaSource.duration`
* is still `NaN`. Once any non-NaN value is present (set by us, or by
* `endOfStream` from the buffered end), the behavior leaves the property
* alone; re-syncing a drift against `presentation.duration` would race with
* concurrent `appendBuffer()` calls.
*
* The entry resolves three async preconditions in order before writing:
*
* 1. **MediaSource open** — `waitForMediaSourceOpen` defers until the first
*    `sourceopen` event (or any readyState transition, since `'ended'` /
*    `'closed'` mean we've missed the window and should bail).
* 2. **All SourceBuffers idle** — `waitForSourceBuffersReady` defers per
*    the MSE-spec rule that `duration` cannot be set while any buffer has
*    `updating === true`.
* 3. **Buffered-range clamp** — `getMaxBufferedEnd` ensures the written
*    duration is at least the highest buffered end (MSE spec disallows
*    a smaller `duration` than any buffered range).
*
* The buffer-set helpers operate across `mediaSource.sourceBuffers` (the
* canonical aggregate), so the behavior composes uniformly across
* audio-only, video-only, and mixed configurations.
*
* Single-positive-state reactor (`'preconditions-unmet'` ↔ `'duration-writable'`):
* state derivation is purely signal-driven (presentation validity +
* mediaSource existence). MediaSource lifecycle state (`readyState`) and
* the `duration` itself are non-signal DOM properties resolved inside the
* entry's async sequence. The state-exit cleanup aborts the in-flight
* wait, so source resets and behavior destroy structurally cancel the
* pending write. A post-await re-check of `mediaSource.readyState ===
* 'open'` covers the narrow race where `endOfStream()` synchronously
* transitions readyState to `'ended'` between our `waitForMediaSourceOpen`
* resolution and the `mediaSource.duration` write.
*
* Downstream of `calculatePresentationDuration` (which writes
* `presentation.duration`); concurrent with `endOfStream` (which may later
* write `mediaSource.duration` — the "exactly once" contract keeps us out
* of that path).
