/**
* **Per-type buffer + segment-loader actor setup.** Per available track
* type (video / audio), when `mediaSource` is attached and the selected
* track of that type is present in the presentation with codecs (partial
* resolution from the multivariant playlist is enough — codecs live on
* the `EXT-X-STREAM-INF` line, not in the per-type media playlist),
* creates a `SourceBuffer`, a `SourceBufferActor`, and a
* `SegmentLoaderActor` bound to that buffer-actor; publishes the per-type
* actor slots. On `mediaSource` detach or behavior destroy, destroys both
* actors in reverse order and clears the per-type slots so the next
* source starts fresh.
*
* Each per-type variant (`setupVideoBufferActors` /
* `setupAudioBufferActors`) is a single-positive-state reactor
* (`'preconditions-unmet'` ↔ `'buffer-ready'`) gating only on its own
* type. No cross-type coupling in `stateKeys` —
* `setupVideoBufferActors` carries only `selectedVideoTrackId` (plus
* `bandwidthState`, written by its trackedFetch), and audio mirrors.
*
* # Firefox `mozHasAudio` invariant
*
* Appending to a video `SourceBuffer` before the audio `SourceBuffer`
* exists causes `mozHasAudio` to be permanently false in Firefox. With
* the two per-type variants decoupled, the invariant is no longer
* structural to a single `entry` body (as it was when both buffers were
* created in one synchronous block inside a merged behavior). It's now
* preserved by a chain of assumptions about how this behavior composes
* with its upstream and downstream siblings:
*
* 1. **Upstream — default selections land in one `runPending`.**
*    `selectAudioTrack` (default audio) and `switchVideoTrack`
*    (default video) both subscribe to `state.presentation` flipping to
*    resolved; their effects run in the same `runPending` iteration and
*    write `selectedAudioTrackId` + `selectedVideoTrackId` within it.
* 2. **Self — both per-type monitors flip in one `runPending`.**
*    After (1), both monitors re-evaluate and flip to `'buffer-ready'`
*    in the next `runPending`. Both `entry` bodies run synchronously
*    within that iteration — both `addSourceBuffer` calls land before
*    the iteration ends.
* 3. **Downstream — `appendBuffer` is async.** `loadVideoSegments` /
*    `loadAudioSegments` read the per-type `xSegmentLoaderActor` slots;
*    their effects fire in the *next* `runPending` and the actual
*    `appendBuffer` requires a network round-trip via the
*    `SegmentLoaderActor` — many microtasks past both `addSourceBuffer`
*    calls.
*
* The cross-tick failure mode — a user-initiated audio track switch
* *after* video segments have begun appending — is out of scope for
* this behavior and would be addressed in the buffer/segment-loading
* path via `changeType`-aware logic.
*
* # Sole writer
*
* `setupVideoBufferActors` is sole writer of `videoBufferActor` +
* `videoSegmentLoaderActor` (and `bandwidthState` via its
* trackedFetch); `setupAudioBufferActors` is sole writer of
* `audioBufferActor` + `audioSegmentLoaderActor`. Both read
* `mediaSource` from `setupMediaSource`. Downstream MSE behaviors
* (`loadVideoSegments`, `loadAudioSegments`, `endOfStream`,
* `updateMediaSourceDuration`) only read these slots.
