/**
 * Derive a stable grouping key for the CDN a URL is served from. Synchronous and
 * pure (deliberately not a `resolve*` — no fetch). Consumers override the
 * default via the engine's `getCdnId` config (e.g. to key on Mux's `cdn=` query
 * param instead of the host); every CDN-identity site reads that same function
 * so keys stay comparable across `cdnPriority`, `failedCdns`, and the
 * track-switching constraint + scope.
