 *
 * No finite states — the snapshot carries `value: 'active' | 'destroyed'`
 * as a universal lifecycle marker rather than domain state. The interesting
 * state is entirely in the context, which is reactive via `snapshot`.
 *
 * Use this when the actor has context that needs to be reactive but no
 * meaningful state machine (e.g., a message-driven model with DOM side
 * effects). For actors that need per-state behavior, use `createMachineActor`.

/**
 * Creates a reducer-shaped actor from an initial context and a reducer function.
 *
 * The reducer receives the current context and a message and returns the next
 * context. Returning the same reference (by identity) skips the signal update —
 * so early-returning `context` unchanged is both the no-op and the optimization.
 *
 * Side effects (e.g. DOM mutations) may be performed inside the reducer.
 * They run synchronously before the signal is updated.
 *
 * @example
 * const actor = createTransitionActor(
 *   { count: 0 },
 *   (context, message: { type: 'increment' }) => ({ count: context.count + 1 })
 * );
