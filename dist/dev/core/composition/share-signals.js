//#region src/core/composition/share-signals.ts
/**
* Behavior factory that hands the composition's signal refs to a
* consumer-supplied callback (`config.onSignalsReady`) at setup time.
*
* Generic over `S` and `C` — the caller instantiates with their own
* state/context types, and the callback's parameter shape is fully
* type-driven from those. Suitable for both reads and writes (per-slot
* intent can be expressed by typing captured refs as `Signal<T>` or
* `ReadonlySignal<T>` at the call site).
*
* By default declares no keys; the composition's state/context maps come from
* other behaviors. Pass `inputStateKeys` / `inputContextKeys` to *materialize*
* consumer-input slots that no other behavior produces — a slot the consumer
* writes (e.g. `userAudioTrackSelection`) but only a rule reads. shareSignals
* is the consumer boundary, so it's the natural place to bring those slots into
* existence; readers then treat them as optional.
*
* Uses a `Behavior<>` literal (not `defineBehavior`) so its (possibly empty,
* possibly partial) key arrays don't trip the exhaustiveness check — the
* setup-param state/context shapes describe what the callback receives (the
* full `S` / `C`), not the subset this behavior materializes.
